; module line format:
; module,description,parameter,pre_install,post_install,initrd,auto
;
; Notes:
;   (1) descriptions starting with '-' are dropped
;   (2) lines with descriptions starting with '--' are dropped (but the
;       modules are added to the section)
;   (3) a parameter starting with '-' indicates that linuxrc should never
;       prompt the user for module params, even in manual mode; instead, this
;       param (without the '-' is used)
;   (4) modules starting with '-' are not added, but the config entry is kept
;   (5) module dependencies are added to pre_install automatically
;
; (1) is mostly a comment; (2) + (4) are useful for af_packet.o (it will be
; automatically loaded after the network modules disk has been read); (3) is
; useful e.g. for modules that don't accept parameters.
